        <p id="uvodp">First of all I want to say hi to my friend and also to say one big THANK YOU for pushing me to start learning programing and recommended me <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy.</a> I want to say that I have alwayes been "technic gay" but because of my very hard life and lot of more difficoult sircumstances I couldn't start to learn programming before, so with this I started to make my dreams about becoming programmer.</p>
        <h2 id="prvikorak"> First step in learning programming</h2>
        <h3>Posted on 16. NOVEMBER in 2022</h3>
        <p id="prvikorakp"> My first step at learning programming was on my regular job night shift few years ago. I know that You all are going to ask: "why did you make such a big brake from learning"? My answer will be simple-FAMILY. I had a lot of obligation to my personal life, my family, my wife, kids and all the other stuff that regular family person has and I didn't manage to plan and do everything that I dream for, such a becoming programmer. </p>
